## Car rental

# What do you need to rent a car?

To rent a car from Our Car rental in the United States and Canada, you will need the following:
- To be 25 years old (if you’re under 25, you may be required to pay a young driver’s fee, which varies by rental location)
- A valid driver's license with a photo
- A photo ID (For example: a driver’s license or passport)
- Credit or debit card (check the acceptable forms of payment at the location you’re renting from)

# What is the scratch policy?

Minor damage to a rental car, such as scratches, dents, or a chipped windshield are covered by the Damage Waiver. The Damage Waiver is an optional protection product you can purchase with your car rental. 

If you choose not to purchase the Damage Waiver and the car gets damaged, you may have to pay out of pocket for any needed repairs. Your personal auto insurance may or may not cover the cost of repairs, so it is best to contact your insurance provider before renting a car.
